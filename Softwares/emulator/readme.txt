	the purpose
	===========

        emu8086 is an emulator of Intel 8086 (AMD compatible) microprocessor
        with an integrated 8086 assembler and tutorials for beginners. the emulator 
        runs programs like the real microprocessor in step-by-step mode.
        it shows registers, memory, stack, variables and flags. 
        values can be investigated and edited by double click.
        instructions can be executed back and forward.

        emu8086 can create a tiny operating system and write its binary code to
        a bootable floppy disk. emu8086 pack includes several external virtual
        devices: robot, stepper motor, led display, and traffic lights intersection. 
        virtually anyone with any programming experience can design 
        animated virtual devices in java, c#, .net, visual basic or 
        even in pure assembly language (see simplest.asm in examples)
